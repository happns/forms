# Happns Forms module

This is the AngularJS module that contains source code of the forms editor used in [https://forms.happns.io](https://forms.happns.io).
The project is using [Happenize](https://github.com/happns/happenize) for development.

## Installation

For the time being the package can be installed only directly from the GitHub.

```sh
npm install happns/forms --save
```

Include the module script in your application, and refrence it in your AngularJS project.

## Development

Install the dependencies:

```sh
bower install
npm install
```

Build the module just once:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can also run the 'watch' which will compile each time something changes in the source code:

```sh
npm run watch
```
